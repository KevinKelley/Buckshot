**Buckshot [buhk-shot]** *noun* A throw when darts land wildly all over the board.

Buckshot is a Google Dart library that provides a declarative presentation framework for modern web browsers.  Some refer to this type of framework as an Application Object Model (AOM).

The framework attempts to separate concerns by pushing as much design (or "view") as possible into declarative templates, leaving the majority of coding to implementation work.
Even so, all aspects of the framework's UI design and interactivity can be developed in Dart code directly.

If you've worked with .net WPF or Silverlight then this framework will feel very familiar to you.

## Buckshot Components
* **Lots of Controls.**  Dozens of controls included with the core library. 
* **Property Binding.**  Set bindings and the framework will handle changes automatically.
* **Events model.** We use it to wrap DOM events and for other internal events, but you can use it in your own apps.
* **Declarative Presentation Templates.** xml based (default) declarative layouts and binding to resources, data, and other elements.
* **Style Templates.**  Use a common style library among multiple elements.  Individual changes to style property values will automatically update any elements using that style.
* **MVVM Support**

## Future Stuff
* Animation
* More controls
* Server-side integration (Dart works on both client and server)
* Free beer (no, but wouldn't it be nice?)
