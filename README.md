### Buckshot [buhk-shot] *noun* A throw when darts land wildly all over the board. ###

Buckshot is a UI Framework for modern web applications. It is written in Google Dart and attempts to model the best of .net WPF (Silverlight) and Adobe Flex, but without the need for a plug-in. Buckshot renders all output in HTML5/CSS3, and makes use of features available in today's modern web browsers.

If you've worked with .net WPF or Silverlight then this framework will feel very familiar to you.

## Buckshot Components
* **Lots of Controls.**  Dozens of controls included with the core library. 
* **Property Binding.**  Set bindings and the framework will handle changes automatically.
* **Events model.** We use it to wrap DOM events and for other internal events, but you can use it in your own apps.
* **Declarative Presentation Templates.** xml based (default) declarative layouts and binding to resources, data, and other elements.
* **Style Templates.**  Use a common style library among multiple elements.  Individual changes to style property values will automatically update any elements using that style.
* **MVVM Support**

* Server-side integration (Dart works on both client and server)
* Free beer (no, but wouldn't it be nice?)
