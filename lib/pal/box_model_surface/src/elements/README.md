## Surface Elements ##
Included in this folder are abstract base elements that are commonly associated
with surface rendering.  Presenter implementations can build on these abstracts
to provide a consistent set of elements and controls.

While it is not required to derive from these abstracts, it is recommended.  At
a minimum, element and control implementations should derive from 
SurfaceElement.
