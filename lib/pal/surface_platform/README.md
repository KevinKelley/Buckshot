## PAL Surface Abstraction ##
A surface is an abstract notion of a 2D visual space. Libraries can build on
surface with specific implementations.  Some examples of these implementations
would be:

* HTML Surface
* SVG
* HTML5 Canvas
* Native client viewport

## Surface Primitives ##
The Surface library provides a set of element abstracts that can be used by
implementing libraries.
