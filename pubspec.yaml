  Buckshot is a UI Framework for modern web applications. It attempts to model
  the best of .net WPF (Silverlight) and Adobe Flex, but without the need for a
  plug-in. Buckshot renders all output in HTML5/CSS3, and makes use of features
  available in today's modern web browsers.  If you've worked with .net WPF or
  Silverlight then this framework will feel very familiar to you.
